Manage personal development projects on a high level without detail clutter

## Description
It seems like most project management tools require far to much detail to quickly and easily manage. I eventually switched to using a simple Google Doc to track the high-level information about each development project I am currently working on. For this use case I don't need in depth tracking &mdash; in fact, I don't want it at all. Since I am also in the process of learning React/Redux I decided to combine the need with the knowledge and start working on an extremely simple web app to track high level project information.

## Features
- Manage a list of projects
  - Show current status (`Pending`, `In Progress`, `Completed`)
- Update individual projects
  - Store high level information (almost meta level)

## Steps
- [ ] Use React to manage project information
- [ ] Switch to Redux to manage state information
- [ ] Create a Node/MongoDB API to store project information
- [ ] Integrate the API into the app
- [ ] Add basic authorization

## Stack
- React/Redux
  - `create-react-app` template
- Node/Express
- MongoDB
